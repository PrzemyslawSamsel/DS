Changed language from Python to Swift - I am learning new language. 
Program does not require any arguments, everything that is needed is in main.swift (setting 4 nodes, 6 processes, 8 resources).
Iâ€™ve added two screenshots - input_example, which shows code I used to generate one specific situation: 
   R1 R2 R3
P1  1 -1
P2 
P3 -1  1
P4
This is obviously a deadlock situation, and appropriate response from the program is seen on second screenshot - output_example. 
This code was deleted, and instead, every time processes and resources are generated randomly, so each time result will be different, and will depend on number of processes and resources.
